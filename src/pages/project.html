                    <strong>1. Names: Your team, the client, and the app (or suite of apps)</strong><br>
                    Team: Nevathan, Abishan, Adrian, Liyu<br>
                    Client: Sam Dovbenyuk (student)<br>
                    Name of Application: Tutor Match<br>
                    An application that matches tutors with tutees, simplifying the process of finding a suitable
                    tutor<br><br>

                    <strong>2. Purpose</strong><br>

                    The "Tutor Match" app is designed to simplify finding and connecting with tutors through a
                    swipe-based interface similar to Tinder. Tutees can swipe right or left on tutors based on criteria
                    such as GPA, major, hourly rate, and past reviews. If both parties swipe right, they are matched and
                    can communicate or schedule sessions. This approach directly addresses the needs identified in the
                    initial client report from Sam Dovbenyuk, who wanted a platform that streamlined the tutor search
                    process, making it faster and more reliable. Sam also noted a gap in the market where existing
                    platforms charge fees for access to tutors. "Tutor Match" solves this problem by offering a free,
                    user-friendly solution that allows students to quickly find and choose tutors based on key academic
                    and financial factors, without the additional costs.<br><br>

                    <strong>3. Data Description</strong><br>
                    Users: To store basic information for all users (tutors and clients). It will include user_id
                    (Primary Key, INT), name (VARCHAR(100)), email (VARCHAR(100)), password (VARCHAR(255)), role
                    (ENUM('tutor', 'client')), and created_at (TIMESTAMP).<br>
                    Tutors: To store tutor-specific details. It will include tutor_id (Primary Key, INT), user_id (INT),
                    GPA (FLOAT), hourly_rate (FLOAT), bio (TEXT), and subjects (VARCHAR(255)).<br>
                    Clients: To store client-specific details. It will include client_id (Primary Key, INT), user_id
                    (INT), preferred_subjects (VARCHAR(255)), and budget (FLOAT).<br>
                    Matches: To track matches between tutors and clients. It will include match_id (Primary Key, INT),
                    tutor_id (INT), client_id (INT), matched_at (TIMESTAMP), and status (VARCHAR(20)).<br>
                    Swipes: To track swipes made by clients on tutors. It will include the swipe_id (Primary Key, INT),
                    client_id (INT), tutor_id (INT), direction (VARCHAR(10)), and swiped-at (TIMESTAMP).<br>
                    Reviews: To store reviews and ratings for tutors. It will include review_id (Primary Key, INT),
                    session_id (INT), rating (INT), comment (TEXT), and reviewed_at (TIMESTAMP)<br><br>

                    <strong>4. Functions performed by the app</strong><br>
                    Create User Profile (INSERT) - Users provide their name, age, courses, GPA, and other relevant
                    information to create their account and select whether they are creating a tutor or tutee
                    account<br>

                    Update user profile (UPDATE) - Users can update relevant profile information<br>

                    Swipe on Tutors (SELECT) - Tutees can swipe to view tutors view information about them and decide if
                    they want to connect with them.<br>

                    Delete Profile (Delete) - Users can delete their profile<br><br>

                    <strong>5. Role of PHP and JavaScript</strong><br>
                    The client side of the app will be built using ReactJS, which allows us to create components for
                    parts of our app. This will include tutor profile cards, swipe functionality, and various pages such
                    as profile setup, browsing tutors, and messaging. React’s state management will help track user
                    interactions, like swipes and matches, in real time without needing to reload the page.
                    Additionally, React’s routing will ensure smooth navigation between pages, creating a seamless
                    experience. JavaScript will handle tasks such as rendering tutor profiles dynamically, responding to
                    swipes or button clicks, and providing instant UI feedback when a match is made. It will also manage
                    form validation for user registration, login, and profile setup to ensure all information is
                    properly entered before being sent to the server.<br>
                    On the back end, PHP will be responsible for managing the database, storing user information, and
                    running the core logic that connects tutors and tutees. When a user swipes on a profile or updates
                    their preferences, PHP will process this data and determine potential matches based on criteria like
                    subject expertise, location, and price. PHP will also manage and handle updates to profiles and
                    match statuses. It will work with the front end by receiving requests from JavaScript, processing
                    the data, and sending back responses in formats like JSON for the front end to interpret and
                    render.<br><br>

                    <strong>6. Roles of Team Members</strong><br>

                    Based on our client report and our team’s strengths, we’ve divided the tasks into four key
                    areas:
                    Backend API and AI Matching Integration (Nevathan/Liyu): Liyu, with the assistance of Nevathan,
                    will
                    lead the design and development of our API endpoints using Node and Express, with a focus on
                    integrating the AI-driven matching algorithm that personalizes connections between tutors and
                    tutees. He will also ensure that the API securely communicates with our SQL database.<br>


                    Dynamic Rating and Pay System (Nevathan/Liyu): Nevathan, with the assistance of Liyu, will focus
                    on
                    building the backend functionality for our dynamic rating and pay system. This involves creating
                    the
                    logic that adjusts tutor rates based on feedback and ensuring that all transactions and updates
                    are
                    reflected accurately in the database.<br>


                    Swipe-based Matching Interface (Adrian): Adrian will spearhead the front-end development of the
                    swipe-based functionality. This includes building an engaging interface with React where tutees
                    can
                    swipe left or right based on tutor preferences, such as rate of pay and education. He will
                    ensure
                    that the interface is responsive and communicates effectively with the backend API.<br>


                    Overall User Interface and Integration (Abishan): Abishan will work on the broader aspects of
                    the
                    front-end design, focusing on the overall look and feel of TutorMatch. This includes integrating
                    the
                    swipe functionality into a cohesive, user-friendly experience and managing the integration of
                    other
                    UI elements like the dynamic rating display, profile information, and resource links.<br>
                    Throughout our development process, each team member will contribute to the JavaScript/PHP code,
                    ensuring that our collaborative efforts meet the assignment's requirements.
                    <br><br>

                    Adrian: Build a preliminary swipe-based interface using React, incorporating static data to
                    simulate the
                    left/right swipe functionality that filters tutor profiles.<br><br>
                    Abishan: Design and integrate the overall user interface, including the landing page and
                    navigation
                    elements, and ensure the swipe interface is responsive across devices.<br><br>

                    Increment 2: Enhanced Platform Features (April 8)<br>
                    Nevathan: Integrate an AI-driven matching algorithm into the API to personalize tutor-tutee
                    connections

                    Liyu: Expand the dynamic rating and pay system by implementing real-time updates based on feedback,
                    ensuring tutors' rates adjust accurately with each interaction.<br><br>
                    Adrian: Upgrade the swipe-based interface to incorporate real-time tutor data, allowing tutees to
                    filter
                    profiles by preferences such as rate of pay and education.<br><br>
                    Abishan: Refine the user interface to include additional details, such as platform credits to Sam
                    and
                    WebFusion, support contact information, and seamless links to further resources while maintaining
                    consistency across mobile and desktop environments.<br><br>

                    <strong>8. Client Feedback</strong><br>

                    During our presentation, we introduced TutorMatch as a platform for tutors and tutees to connect.
                    Still,
                    our client Sam emphasized that while the basic concept was solid, it needed to offer something more
                    innovative to stand out. Sam remarked, "I like the idea of a meeting platform, but you need to offer
                    something more innovative than what everyone else is doing," and he stressed that "just connecting
                    tutors and tutees isn’t enough; there has to be a distinctive feature that sets us apart." Taking
                    his
                    feedback into account, we decided to add swipe functionality, where tutees can swipe left or right
                    based
                    on their tutor preferences, including factors such as pay rate and education. Additionally, we are
                    planning to integrate an AI-driven matching algorithm to personalize connections and introduce a
                    dynamic
                    rating and pay system that rewards tutors based on positive feedback from tutees. We are also
                    committed
                    to developing an engaging, user-friendly interface that works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop
                    devices. While TutorMatch is still in development, these planned enhancements are designed to
                    transform
                    it from a simple meeting platform into a dynamic and innovative ecosystem.

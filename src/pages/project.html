                    This project aims to create a multiplayer web game hub, which will contain classic games such as Tic
                    Tac Toe and Connect Four, alongside some new additions. We expect most desktop traffic over mobile
                    users, as web games like this tend to be used as a break from work, a quick game to play at work or
                    school, which a mobile user would instead download a simple game app for. The site will still be
                    designed responsively and be mobile-friendly, however, it will provide an optimized experience for
                    computer screen sizes. The website will display some static information, including the site name,
                    credit to Sam as well as WebFusion, a company email for user support and reporting bugs, links to
                    WebFusion and any of Sam’s platforms if he is willing, and Terms of Service. In terms of design, the
                    page will feature a dark theme with vibrant colors like blue and pink to match an arcade aesthetic.
                    Following this theme, the page will feature pixel art and subtle animations. The fonts used should
                    be sans-serif and a mix of futuristic as well as retro. The home page and game pages will all
                    feature a consistent design. Finally, all pages should be responsive and mobile-friendly. Data
                    processing will include game data that allows the games to function properly, game leaderboards,
                    game performance metrics (i.e. how many clicks a game has, likes/dislikes, etc…), and player
                    achievements. For interactivity, the games themselves will cover most of this (spin the wheel,
                    trivia quizzes, and tic tac toe are all interactive by nature) however the home page will feature
                    interactive animations to bring life to it as well. In addition, there will be: an option to change
                    between a dark and light mode, animations for achievements to make them flashy and fun, and a
                    digital trophies section where a player can view all their achievements.
